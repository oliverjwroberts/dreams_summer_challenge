🌞📊 DREAMS Summer Challenge: Unlock the Strength of Visual Insights!🚀🔍
=====================

📣 Calling all data science enthusiasts! Are you ready to put your analytical skills to the test and embark on an exciting summer challenge? Join us for an immersive data science competition and get ready to showcase your talent, learn new techniques, and gain recognition in the DREAMS community!

🔍 Challenge Description
-------------------------
Your task is to explore a health related dataset (or multiple) of your choosing, identify any interesting patterns, and create compelling visualisations that effectively communicate the health-related information.

> IMPORTANT: The dataset must be publicly available and not contain any personally identifiable or other sensitive information!

In an attempt to encourage creativity, you are free to choose any health dataset(s) that you are interested in. However, we appreciate this can be quite overwhelming. If you are unsure about where to start, the following links may be of interest:

* [Nomis - Population Estimates/Projects](https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/sources/pest)
* [Office for National Statistics - Population Projects](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationprojections/datasets/2020basedinterimnationalpopulationprojectionsyearendingjune2022estimatedinternationalmigrationvariant)
* [Office for National Statistics - Health and Social Care](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare)

This challenge welcomes entries from all ability levels. Whether you're a data visualisation whizz or just starting out, this is a perfect opportunity to experiment. In fact, we encourage trying something new.

🎨 Visualisation Tasks
-----------------------
1. Exploratory Data Analysis: Dive deep into the health dataset and perform exploratory data analysis. Identify trends, correlations, outliers, or any other interesting characteristics of the data that can provide valuable insights related to health.
2. Interactive Visualisations: Create interactive visualisations that allow users to explore the health dataset dynamically. Use tools and libraries such as Matplotlib, Plotly, or R Shiny to build engaging visual representations that enable users to interact with the health data and uncover hidden insights.
3. Storytelling through Visuals: Tell a captivating story using data visualisations in the health domain. Develop a narrative that takes the audience through the dataset, highlighting key findings, and presenting a compelling storyline related to health. Use visual elements, annotations, and narratives to convey your message effectively.

🏆 Evaluation Criteria
-----------------------
Participants will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

1. Creativity and Originality: The uniqueness and innovativeness of your health visualisations and storytelling approach.
2. Clarity and Effectiveness: How well the visualisations communicate the insights and information related to health.
3. Aesthetic Appeal: The overall design, colour schemes, and visual aesthetics of your health representations.
4. Accessibility: Consideration of accessibility principles to ensure that the visualisations are inclusive and can be accessed by a wide range of users.
5. Storytelling: The ability to convey a narrative and engage the audience through the visualisations related to health.

🎖️ Recognition and Rewards
---------------------------
Participants in the challenge will have the opportunity to gain recognition and rewards in the following ways:

1. Certificates of Achievement: The top three participants with the most exceptional health visualisations will receive personalised certificates of achievement, recognising their outstanding contributions to the challenge.
2. Announcement on Yammer: The winners will be announced on our official Yammer group, where data science professionals and health enthusiasts can celebrate your achievements.
3. Presentation Opportunity: The first-place winner will have the exclusive opportunity to present their work in a workshop organised by DREAMS community. This is a chance to share your insights, techniques, and experiences with a wider audience.

And of course, we hope everyone who participates will have fun and learn something new!
